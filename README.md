# Music-Classification
Using CNN and LSTM to do a music classification task based on Caffe and Theano.

A detailed report can be found in Music Classification with Neural Network.pdf. 

In this paper, we introduced LSTM, CNN and RCNN as new tools for music classification. The dataset we choose is GTZAN. It is easy to find on Internet.

## A short introduction to the file folders

	"datapre" is used for preparation of Music data. Here we use the transfer the music segaments into spectrum by FFT. 

	"CNN"  contains convolutional neuron network. Data was converted into fitted format in advance.

	"LSTM" contains LSTM network.
